# devopsdays-theme
devopsdays-theme is the Hugo theme for the [DevOpsDays](https://www.devopsdays.org) website.

# Theme Layout
Bear in mind that this theme lives in a separate repo from the main [devopsdays-web repo](https://github.com/devopsdays/devopsdays-web). No changes should be made to the `themes/devopsdays-theme` directory in `devopsdays-web`. If changes need to be made to the theme, they should be made in this repo, and a new version released, and the theme installed into `devopsdays-web`.

# New Features

## Frontpage Logo

On the new homepage, upcoming events are listed with a square thumbnail. If this is not set (the way it is to be set is TBD), then the default logo is displayed instead.

## Program Page
A new template is being created to generate a program page. A work in progress example can be seen at http://devopsdays-theme.netlify.com/events/2016-chicago/program/

This is an opt-in feature; the page will need to be set for the type of program in order to generate it.

## Blog
Blog posts now support setting an "author" name in the frontmatter; for example, like this:

```
+++
Title = "Minneapolis 2016 in review"
Date = "2016-08-08T15:59:27-05:00"
Tags = ["2016"]
Author = "Bridget Kromhout"
+++
```

If an author is not specified, attempts to display it are ignored.


# Developing devopsdays-theme
Working with a Hugo theme outside of a content-based repo has a few challenges. The `devopsdays-theme` repo contains a directory called `exampleSite`, which is what is used for testing theme development. The `config.toml` for the `exampleSite` contains the following value:

```
themesdir = "../.."
```

This tells Hugo where to look for its theme directories. This requires Hugo 0.18 or later.

You will need to run your watch command from the `exampleSite` directory; use something like this:

```
hugo server -w --baseUrl="http://localhost:1313"
```

## Contributing
Please submit your proposed changes as a Pull Request against this repository. If the PR will resolve an issue, please add `Fixes #123` to the PR.

## v3 Design
The design and layout can be found in [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzljU_vIF4BoOHhLV2Yzd2xicEk/view?usp=sharing). Please refer to the [Style Guide](https://github.com/devopsdays/devopsdays-theme/blob/master/STYLE.md) for all colors, fonts, and sizes of text elements, etc.

## Design Principles

### Blocks
All page templates should make use of the `layouts/_default/baseof.html` file. This file contains all wrappers for the content. Anything within the `{{- block "main" . }} {{- end -}}` section is what will be displayed on a sub-template. Include a `{{ define "main" }}` block in your template to include what should be rendered.

### CSS and LESS
All CSS must be generated with LESS. The LESS files are located in `static/less`, with two exceptions, `static/site_variables.less` and `static/site.less`.

#### `site_variables.less`
This is the only place you should declare custom LESS variables that our LESS files will use. Currently, `static/less/bootstrapp.less` has a single modification, which is to include `@import "../site_variables.less";`. If the version of Bootstrap is ever updated, this change must be re-added.

#### `site.less`
This is the only place you should declare custom LESS or CSS code.

## Continuous Integration
The `devopsdays-theme` repo has hooks into Travis, Appveyor and Netlify. Currently, the Travis build doesnâ€™t do very much (the intent is to add some testing using Casper.js for web testing, but no tests have been written. The Appveyor tests ensure that the site can build with Windows.

All changes are built by Netlify to http://devopsdays-theme.netlify.com

### Asset Pipeline
There is no current asset processing in place, but the intent is to add some, to provide HTML minification as well as image optimization. This is currently an outstanding task, tracked in [Issue #10](https://github.com/devopsdays/devopsdays-theme/issues/10) and [Issue #11](https://github.com/devopsdays/devopsdays-theme/issues/11).

# Releasing `devopsdays-theme`

To cut a new release, a tag must be created. This will trigger Travis to deploy a new release. Follow these steps:

1. Update the `theme_version` key in `theme.toml` to the new version.
1. Add the appropriate tag to the latest commit. The tags are named by the SemVer version number of the theme, with only numbers (that is, `1.1.31` vs `v1.1.31`)
1. Push to `origin master`, including tags (if you don't know how to do this, ask!)

Once the Travis build has succeeded, update the changelog:

1. Make sure you have the [`github_changelog_generator`](https://github.com/skywinder/github-changelog-generator) gem installed on your system
1. Inside the repository, run `github_changelog_generator`.
1. Run `git add CHANGELOG.md`
1. Commit the changed file
1. Push to `origin master`
