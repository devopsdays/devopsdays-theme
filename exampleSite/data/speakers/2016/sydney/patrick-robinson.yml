bio: "I have worked as a systems/devops engineer for 5 years mostly on large distributed platforms. I am easily bored with repetitive work and find myself constantly trying to automate myself out of a job, but alas have not yet succeeded.
I currently work at Envato, an e-commerce company specialising in creative digital media.
My current technical interests are container orchestration and learning Golang and Elixir."
