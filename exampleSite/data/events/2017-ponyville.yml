    bio: "At high school, George Michael is hardly known by any other students but gets good grades. He is paid to tutor Maeby, but instead, she plagiarizes from him. He briefly develops a crush on his teacher Beth Baerly because she paid attention to him. (\"Shock and Aww\") He lost the student council election, receiving only 3% of the votes. (\"The Immaculate Election\")<p>
    George Michael's good grades continue through college. To get into Julliard, George Michael develops a fake woodblock app with his roommate P-Hound called [Fakeblock](http://arresteddevelopment.wikia.com/wiki/Fakeblock). One small lie causes the app to get blown out of proportion by Maeby who thinks it is privacy software."
