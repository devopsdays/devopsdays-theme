Learn how to [organize your own devopsdays event](/pages/organizing)!

After each event, local organizers link to slides and videos from their event; check individual event programs for more info. (Videos from some past events are collected in a [shared account](https://vimeo.com/devopsdays/albums); event videos since 2016 are linked from event programs.)
