A service mesh is necessary for organizations adopting microservices and dynamic cloud based infrastructure. Traditional host-based network security must be replaced with modern service-based security to accommodate the highly dynamic nature of modern runtime environments.

* Configuration Services must accept runtime configuration from a central source.
* Segmenation: Service communication must be authorized and encrypted.
