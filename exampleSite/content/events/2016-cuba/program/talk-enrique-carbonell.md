Infrastructure as Code is the automation in the DevOps movement. It is about dynamic
infrastructure as a software system, which means that development practices like TDD, BDD,
CI, and CD would be used. In some cases, our development and operations teams are using tools
such as CFEngine, Puppet, Chef, Ansible, Salt, etc. But not many are using them to their full
potential and with test approach. This talk explains some of the core challenges of managing
infrastructure and shares how do Test Driven Infrastructure in general terms. The talk walks
through from definition of the usual problems managing infrastructures to implementation of
infrastructure project with Ansible in order to build a change management pipeline to automatically
test and release infrastructure projects. Attendees should come away with an understanding of how
concepts such as Test Driven Development, Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery can be
applied to infrastructure.
