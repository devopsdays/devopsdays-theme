We have an exciting new venue for our 2017 conference, [Noah's Event Venue](http://www.noahseventvenue.com)

Did  you get a chance to attend our inaugural 2016 DevOps Days Event held here in beautiful Salt Lake City? If not, we understand, you maxed the location capacity of 250 attendees, which meant a LOT of you were left out (75 + waitlisted, a bunch of “please just let me in,” and only 5 no shows).

We heard your request for this year’s capacity-bigger. Good thing because, in our sophomore year, Salt Lake DevOps Days 2017 is set to have over 400+ attendees. Yup, 400+.
