Everything I need to know, I learned in Tanzania

I volunteered for a Tanzanian nonprofit that publishes teenager-focused magazines about sexuality and AIDS. My task: code an internal tool to track deliveries. My lesson: focus on people. On a used machine with corrupt RAM and no clock, we together developed a delivery-tracking system that has survived 8 years and several staffing changes. It lasts because its users care about it.

This is a talk about the micro: a pitiful server; zero budget; few users. We made tiny tweaks to our office culture, and now our magazines reach their recipients across a huge country.
