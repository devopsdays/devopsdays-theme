Innovation, disruption, and discontinuity: Technology isn’t interesting. It’s the effects of technology, and the discontinuities they trigger, that alter fortunes, upend industries, and change society forever.

It’s a wide-ranging, thought-provoking look at what the future might hold, and how to think about a world where unknowable change is the norm.
