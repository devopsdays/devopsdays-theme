		<h3>How to get to the venue by public transport from the Riga center</h3>
		<p>There are a lot of options how you can get to venue from the city center. Check out <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/56.9469913,24.1200244/Park+Inn+by+Radisson+Riga+Valdemara,+Krogus+iela,+Zemgale+Suburb,+Riga">Google Maps</a>, and try to find the route best suited to your current location. Our recommendation would probably be to use the 1st or the 5th tram and get off at Kalnciema street, but there are other options available as well, for example, 9th trolleybus.</p>
