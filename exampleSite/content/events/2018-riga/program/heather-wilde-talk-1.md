<p>Burnout often has been seen as an indicator of success and working hard, when it’s actually harming the growth of our developer communities and teams. Heather Wilde will talk about burnout culture. She is CTO of ROCeteer, personal and professional growth expert, executive coach, author, and speaker. As a founding employee of Evernote, she oversaw the company’s growth from thousands to 100,000,000 customers. Wilde’s writing as a columnist for Inc and Forbes spans social media, entrepreneurialism, startups, leadership, fundraising, and diversity issues.</p>
