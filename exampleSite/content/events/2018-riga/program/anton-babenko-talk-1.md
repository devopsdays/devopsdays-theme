<p>Letâ€™s go through the real scenarios of implementing AWS security best-practices using Terraform and see what does it take to make a process of managing hundreds of IAM users, groups, roles using Terraform. I work with 'Terraform' and 'Packer' on a daily basis since August 2015. I have created several open-source projects related to Terraform during last couple years. The most popular one is where I manage a collection of verified 'Terraform' AWS modules (terraform-aws-modules on GitHub). They were downloaded 1M times," says Anton Babenko, a long time developer, CTO, and tech-lead. He also leads AWS, DevOps and HashiCorp User Groups in Norway, organizes DevOpsDays Oslo, and speaks often at various technical meetups and conferences.</p>
