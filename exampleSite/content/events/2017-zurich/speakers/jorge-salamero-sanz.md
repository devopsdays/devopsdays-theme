Jorge co-founded Zentyal, a successful open source Exchange protocol interoperability
company. He now drives Server Density evangelism, showing potential customers and
community members best practices adopting DevOps practices and monitoring their
infrastructure.

He enjoys monitoring all the things, writing sensors plugins and DIY projects with
Raspberry PI and Arduino. All automated with either Puppet cookbooks or Ansible playbooks.
When he is away from computers, you will find him walking with his 2 dogs across the
countryside.
