At my day job, we went through a long roller coaster ride to find out how to efficiently deploy our microservices-based SaaS-platform on a daily basis having multiple deploys done by different developers to different cloud providers. As in our company, we are big proponents of the "SRE book" by Google I'll explain why in my opinion the future belongs to such technologies as Mesos and Kubernetes. Also, why developers in our company need nothing but Git to deploy their apps and how we've stopped caring about how your Docker containers are running by empowering machines to do that for us.
