Cardinal Health is a massive organization and undergoing massive changes. Jim will walk us through Cardinal’s devops approach. He’ll discuss the spectrum of models from DIY to “White Glove” of enablement. Additionally, he’ll discuss the key principles they’re following that are applicable from a web-based java app to a green screen mainframe app and offshoring considerations.
