  <h3>Sharing : What's in it for me!?</h3>

  <p>Sharing.  It's one of the four pillars of CAMS.  We consume so much shared content but have we ever thought about sharing from the point of view of the Sharer? Why should I share? If I'm constantly sharing information what do I get out of it? What's in it for me!?  </p>

  <p>This ignite talk looks at sharing through the eyes of a Sharer.  What benefits do they receive out of sharing? What cultural or psychological benefits are there?</p>
