## Thank you for sponsoring DevOpsDays Seattle!

As you probably know, DevOpsDays is a volunteer run not-for-profit event. Our goal is to help people learn about DevOps, and we couldn’t do it without your support.

Thank You!!

### Things you should do right away
#### Book your hotel rooms!
A lot of hotels in Seattle sell out in the spring. It’s a good idea to book any rooms you’ll need as soon as possible.

#### Register your attendees.
You’ll receive a registration code to be given to people who will be attending on behalf of your company. Please don’t wait to have them register! We’d like to have an accurate count as soon as possible. If you haven’t received your code please email {{< email_organizers >}}

### Venue Location
McCaw Hall<br>
321 Mercer St<br>
Seattle, WA 98109

Information about the venue can be found at https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2017-seattle/location

### Dates and Times
This year’s event is on Wednesday, Apr 26, 2017 and Thursday, Apr 27, 2017

The schedule for the day is at https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2017-seattle/program/ - As of this writing (21 February 2017) the times are not final! The start and finish times are unlikely to change very much, but the session schedule will.

##### Access to the venue for setup will be at 7AM on day one. You’ll want to be ready to go when attendee registration opens at 8AM.

Tear down is after the last break on day two.

Please don’t tear down early!

### Who to Send
Of course this is up to you, but most attendees will be practitioners. It’s important to your success that you send people able to have practitioner level conversations. If you’re showing off your latest product, be ready to answer some technical questions. If you’re looking to hire people, have someone there who works in the type of role you’re hiring for.

### Conference Format

DevOpsDays is a unique blend of presentation style talks and interactive open discussions. The presentations are being chosen from over 130 submissions. We’re really excited about the talks we’ll see.

The afternoons are run as open spaces. You can learn more about this format at https://www.devopsdays.org/open-space-format/. To make the most of your participation it’s highly recommended that your staff participate in the open space discussions. This is your best chance to show off how valuable you can be to the attendees.

### Shipping
The venue does not offer direct shipping / receiving.

There is a 24 / 7 FedEx Office location a few blocks away at:<br>
606 1st Ave N<br>
Seattle, WA 98109<br>
http://local.fedex.com/wa/seattle/office-0736/

This location offers “Hold at FedEx Location” services, so items can be shipped there and picked up in time to set up your table. If you need assistance on how to ship them please contact them at 206-285-1071

### Lead Collection
We don’t share attendee information with sponsors.

You’re welcome to ask people to share their contact information voluntarily. It’s very common for sponsors to hold drawings for this purpose and we will have a time and the end of day 2 to announce winners.

Most attendees will not have business cards, so you’ll want to have a way to capture this information. Some sponsors will bring slips of paper and a punchbowl, others will use something like Google Forms on a laptop or tablet.
