  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
Demystifying docker networking black magic
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>
One of the most important parts of Docker is the ability it has to
manage container networking in different scenarios.
As Arthur C. Clarke might say, Docker networking is a technology now
sufficiently advanced that it become indistinguishable from magic.
The purpose of this talk is to demystify the last statement with
explanations supported by use cases and demos of how networking is
handled in Docker and in the containers world in general.
