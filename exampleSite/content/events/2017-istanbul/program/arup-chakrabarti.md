  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
The Great PagerDuty DevOps Heist of 2016
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>
---You build it, you own it, you operate it--- has become our mantra at PagerDuty. But how did we get there? Where were we before his? How did we go from having a centralized team responsible for anything Infrastructure related to dozens of engineers building and deploying their own services? 

In this talk, I will talk about some of the technical and cultural changes we had to make at PagerDuty to accomplish this. While we are not done with our DevOps journey, we have been consciously at it for years and have had some successes while making many many mistakes.
