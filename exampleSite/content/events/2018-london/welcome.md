    <p><b>Thanks for everything, see you next time. Don't worry if you missed it you can catch up on the event below!</b></p>
    <p>The first DevOpsDays was held in Ghent, Belgium in 2009. Since then, DevOpsDays events have multiplied and expanded globally with over 55 events planned for 2018.</p>
    <p>DevOpsDays is a worldwide series of community run technical conferences covering topics of software development, IT infrastructure operations, and the intersection between them. It is run by volunteers from community, for the benefit of the community.
      We are not a commercial conference and we believe that our focus on serving the community creates a truly unique experience for both delegates and sponsors.
    </p>
    <p>We expect 600 people this year and will be holding the event on September 20-21, 2018 at the QEII Centre in Westminster.</p>
    <p>The format of DevOpsDays London includes a single track of 30 minute talks in the morning of each event, followed by Ignite talks (5 minute, auto forwarding). We spend the rest of the afternoon in Open Spaces, which are considered a key portion
      of the event.
