  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
Abstractions and Metaphors: words matter in operations
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>
Is a retrospective better than a post-mortem? Is an incident room better than a war-room? Working in the automation/operations space we deal with abstractions and metaphors constantly, even when it's unconscious. In this talk we'll be taking a quick tour through some interesting linguistic theories around metaphor and abstraction, and discuss how our thoughts and actions in our space are shaped by the metaphors we use.
