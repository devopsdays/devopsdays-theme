  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
Why?: the forgotten word of DevOps
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>
We all know DevOps is not about the tools or the process, itâ€™s about a deeper cultural movement. But all too often we think about what DevOps is, and miss the focus on Why we do it in the first place.</p>

<p>In this presentation we explore:</p>

<ul>
<li>The organisational context that is most likely to support a successful DevOps initiative</li>
<li>What questions you should be asking and how to frame the conversation when engaging with organisational leaders and non technical colleagues</li>
<li>How to connect the key values a DevOps initiative can generate with real business problems</li>
<li>Why we do all this</li>
</ul>
