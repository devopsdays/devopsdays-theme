  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
10 rules of automation
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>
The basis of the talk comes from Patrick's experience automating the wrong way, and the things he's learned doing it again. It's easy to look at a problem and think "I know I'll automate it!". This can be an easy trap to fall into. Automation does not make robust maintainable platforms; but when combined with a well grounded knowledge of building systems (particularly distributed systems) is a powerful tool.
Patrick will explore the common pitfalls:
</p>
<ul>
<li>automating error prone processes</li>
<li>choosing the wrong tool</li>
<li>overly complex automation</li>
<li>automating pets</li>
<li>placing your automation at the wrong end of the pipeline</li>
</ul>
<p>
In the end Patrick hopes to show participants how automation, used judiciously, can be extremely effective. Patrick will likely also delve into a recent project he worked on, successfully migrating an Alexa top 1000 site to AWS.
