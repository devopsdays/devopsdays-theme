Functions as a Service: Beyond the rainbow
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>
Serverless and AWS lambda is generating a lot of attention at the moment. But what is it really like to live with services without the servers? What does this new deployment style mean for development teams trying to get things done? What about operations? Do we even need dedicated ops people when this becomes the norm? At REA we have been experimenting with Lambda for quite some time now, in this talk I’ll share some experiences and lesions we have learnt along the way. I’ll also try and answer the above questions and where I see this going from here.
