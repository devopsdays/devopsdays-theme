  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
Do small data sets dream of big data?
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>
As a startup, it's imperative to have a firm grasp of the way your user base interacts with your product in order to progress and improve.  In this talk, I will outline how we at Fillr, went from spending money on Facebook to get users, to using data from our own users to get more users, and save a whole heap of money along the way. At the end of the presentation, the attendees will hopefully have a better understanding of the challenges that this approach poses, and the benefits of taking them head on like:
</p>
<ul>
<li>How to work with a very small user base to generate usage patterns.</li>
<li>Why advertising on Facebook was of no consequence to us.</li>
<li>How to setup data visualisation mechanisms and save money while doing it.</li>
<li>Using usage patterns to further expand and improve your product.</li>
<li>Building retention patterns to check your assumptions and fail quick.</li>
<li>Introduce experimentation, rapid failure to every facet of your product lifecycle based on data accumulated.</li>
<li>Investing in your team to improve both their skills and your product.</li>
<li>Why learnings is not a word.</li>
<li>How to remove gut feel and guesswork from your workplace.</li>
</ul>
<p>
This presentation will have a very big emphasis on
</p>
<ul>
<li>Open source software, both taking from and contributing back.</li>
<li>Real world examples of collaborating across the business between UX, engineering and our CEO.</li>
<li>Using Elasticsearch, Cornelius, d3js to set up a system of data visualisation to enable the entire business to analyse our growth.</li>
<li>Explanation of what Gandalf could have learnt from the DevOPS movement.</li>
