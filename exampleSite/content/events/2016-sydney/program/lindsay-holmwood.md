  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
Deepening our people, to weather the org
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>
Devops is about changing technical culture. But technical culture isn’t created in a vacuum – it's nurtured and reinforced by the broader organisational culture our tech orgs are part of.
</p>
<p>
That culture comes from people – our artifacts, beliefs, and assumptions. Unless we deepen our people's skills, knowledge, and experience, we'll get the culture change we deserve.
</p>
<p>
What does technical culture change look like, and how does it survive? And why are people the hardest but most important piece of the puzzle to change?
