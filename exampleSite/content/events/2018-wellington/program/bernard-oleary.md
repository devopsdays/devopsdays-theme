AI and Machine Learning are at-or-about the top of the Gartner Hype Cycle right now, indicating that they should be approached and invested in with caution. There are a range of real-world uses of AI and Machine Learning which can enable DevOps practices now though.

Workshop Requirements
We'll be working through developing a custom machine learning solution for predicting whether a pull-request (or code merge) will result in a bug.

There will be some maths content, but it will be relatively light and hopefully I will explain it all well enough. 

People will need to have the following installed (all of this works on any platform - Windows/Linux/Mac):

• Git version control software <br/>
• Jupyter Notebook: http://jupyter.org/install <br/>
• Python (which is a prerequisite for Jupyter anyway) <br/>
• Pip: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/ <br/>
• Python libraries: <br/>
• sklearn:  http://scikit-learn.org/stable/ <br/>
• numpy:  http://www.numpy.org/ <br/>
• pandas: https://pandas.pydata.org/ <br/>
• matplotlib: https://matplotlib.org/ <br/>

Will spend a few minutes at the start of the tutorial making sure that everyone has these setup correctly anyway.
