Nigel loves finding ways to help people improve what they are doing - whether as an organiser of DevOpsDays NZ, project lead for the open-source Concordion framework or growing Assurity's DevOps service offerings. In his spare time, you'll often find him planting trees in Tanera Gully or enjoying a crafty Garage Project beer.
