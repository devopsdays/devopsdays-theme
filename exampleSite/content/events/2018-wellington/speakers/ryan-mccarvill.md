Ryan's currently the DevOps lead at Verifone where he works to automate payment gateways in New Zealand and Australia. Before that he was working for Fire and Emergency NZ as part of a small team to deliver a new incident response system to emergency service workers. He used to make horrible short films but was forced to stop when all his friends got married. For some reason he keeps building databases and word processors as a hobby.
