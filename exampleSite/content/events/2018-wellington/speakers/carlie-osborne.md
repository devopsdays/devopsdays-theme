Carlie has been working in software delivery since 2004, after discovering a keen talent for spotting broken stuff and finding a great career for this in testing.  Over the next 14 years, working in various roles from testing and delivery, through to product management, she has a developed a spidey sense for transforming the way software is delivered and using Agile practises to work smarter and get great features in front of users, faster. Carlie is currently the Channel Manager for ANZ Internet Banking.

As a Brit married to a Kiwi, Carlie enjoys bringing different views and practises together and has been working at ANZ for the last 4 years, helping technology needs and business needs come closer together to do great things - unlike the UK and the European union. 

Carlie enjoys travelling with her family, learning piano and hearing that her husband is back uninjured from a Wellington mountain bike ride (generally a low probability).
