I work at Kuehne + Nagel as a System Analyst for the KN FreightNet project in Hamburg since 2011. Originally from Venezuela, I live in Germany since 2009. I started my career as a software developer and step by step changed the direction until I became a full-time requirements engineer, collaborating as well with the internal agile-coaching team with Retrospectives-moderation. Agile by nature, I consider fostering collaboration and communication in my team a key part of daily work. I am passionate about DevOps, since my department became the first one successfully implementing continuous deployment in the whole IT organization.
