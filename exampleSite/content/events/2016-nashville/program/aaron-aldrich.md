  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
  Better living thorugh Storytelling
  </p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>
As a social species, we’ve developed many tools for communication. Before there was written word, we were telling stories around communal fires to share the dangers and enforce societal values. As we’ve continued to develop faster and more efficient forms of communication, we’re missing out on the key thing that makes us human: The stories. Nothing in our lives has meaning except for the story behind it. If you’re sharing raw metric data about application performance, it means nothing if it doesn’t tell a story. Even if we’re just sending “No.” through text, we’re telling a story about more than just that response. Recognizing the stories we tell and honing our storytelling skills will improve communication, collaboration and community amongst our peers.
