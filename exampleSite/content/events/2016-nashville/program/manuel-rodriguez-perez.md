  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
  Please forgive me! â€“ Confessions from a Silo and How I Learned to Believe in the Business Value of DevOps
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>
I humbly ask for your forgiveness. I was once the cause of your IT delivery issues. I made developers and application owners wait, sometimes, up to 4 weeks for a VM! And I am now pretty ashamed. Then when I became an application owner, the cruel joke was played on me. So I demanded and deployed without a care. Both times incentives and organizations were misaligned and misinformed. This is a story about living in those two extremes, the perspective gained from a business degree, and how I came to believe that DevOps is what Modern IT [Business] should look like.
