  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
  Ops for Africa
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>
Last year I worked as a network and infrastructure engineer for the West Africa Ebola response and polio eradication efforts in Nigeria. Rather than talking about our projects or the not-so-special technology we used I'd like to talk about the unique organizational challenges my team faced. A lot of common approaches fall apart in the contexts we worked in. Particularly interesting is the limited connectivity and how that changes communication between different parts of the organization.
