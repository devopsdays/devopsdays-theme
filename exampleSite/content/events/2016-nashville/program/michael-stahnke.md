  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
  Management or Technical?
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>
Have you ever been pressed in your career about whether you want to management or technical? I get asked this a lot. My answer is always, “why do I have to choose?” I’d like to dive into the root of this question and then cover ways in which you can be a leader and still be a technical contributor. It’s a challenge, but certainly possible. I’ll draw on my experience over the last five years at Puppet, Inc.

Items Covered:
<ul>
<li>What is technical work anyway?</li>
<li>Prioritization is most important</li>
<li>Check your title when doing technical work</li>
<li>Don’t put yourself on critical path</li>
<li>Don’t fall into micromanagement designs</li>
</ul>
