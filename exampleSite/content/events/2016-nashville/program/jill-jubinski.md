  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
  Raised This Way: DevOps Lessons I Learned from My Family
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>
There are and will always be ongoing debates over the definition of ‘Devops' and how to implement it in our highly technical world. As a member of the DevOps community for many years I know these opposing views intimately, but I can’t help thinking I came into this arena knowing a lot of the fundamental principles. Looking back, I realized that it’s because everything I know about DevOps I actually learned from my family. Sit back, relax and enjoy a little Jubinski family history and everything you’ve ever wanted to know about DevOps without discussing tech at all
