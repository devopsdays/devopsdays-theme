  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
  Patterns of Empathy in DevOps
  </p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>
Communication is a bedrock of DevOps practices. Empathic communication among teams and stakeholders leads to better understanding, a shared vision, and ultimately healthier and more productive team dynamics. 
</p>
<p>
Interacting empathically with other humans is a skill worth practicing. In this talk we'll explore some common patterns, the underlying science, and supporting technologies that can help develop empathetic skills that you might not get to practice mindfully while doing the technical parts of your daily work.
</p>
<p>
Even mimicking these behaviours, through the power of habit and neuroplasticity, can build empathy between team members leading to improve team dynamics and DevOps-y-ness.
