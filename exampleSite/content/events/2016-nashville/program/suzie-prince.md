  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
  Tips for selling Continuous Delivery and DevOps to your business (from a business person)
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>
Explaining why businesses should do continuous delivery (CD) can be hard. Businesses have roadmaps and plans and getting them to do development or operations work for a practice they donâ€™t understand can be daunting. As a product manager I want to share with you how you can convince people like me (product managers) and others in your business why you should practice continuous delivery and build a DevOps culture.
