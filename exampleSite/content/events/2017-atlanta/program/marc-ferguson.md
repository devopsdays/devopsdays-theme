Many companies have long recognized the link between productivity and a fun work environment. “Play” is not just essential for kids; it can be an important source of relaxation and stimulation for adults as well. Adult play is a time to forget about work and commitments, and to be social in an unstructured, creative way. Play can add joy to life, relieve stress, supercharge learning, and connect you to others and the world around you.

Incorporating play in an environment that some may habitually consider super serious and not fun may do wonders to the morale of employees. The results of gaming at the office teaches one how to be functional while under stress, refreshes the mind and body, encourages teamwork, and most importantly triggers creativity and innovation. With a workforce equipped with such positive attributes it’d be difficult to compete against them.
