App development rarely envisions — let alone designs for —
the prospect of death of a user or someone close to them. Death is a
human factor. Another uncomfortable one to think and talk about. But
it constantly is impacting how people interact with product, company,
and fellow users. So we need to integrate their reality into our
feature development, personas, threat modeling, and tech support. We
can successfully balance technical concerns with compassion for people
who grapple with tech complications while in mourning. We'll look at
how.
