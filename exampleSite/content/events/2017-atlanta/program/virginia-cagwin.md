Don Norman and Jakob Nielsen say “In order to achieve high-quality user experience in a company’s offerings there must be a seamless merging of the services of multiple disciplines, including engineering, marketing, graphical and industrial design, and interface design.”

What does continuous UX evaluation look like? How do we meet users expectations? What does it look like to merge UX into DevOps practices? I’ll answer these questions and discuss the similarity of Lean UX and devOps processes and how they can work together to bring better experiences to end users and team members.

I’ll discuss the similarities in process and how we need to take a continuous assessment and monitoring approach. I’ll discuss the business impact of UX, both negative and positive. In conclusion, I’ll talk about how through understanding your users, measuring and monitoring what matters, we can merge UX and DevOp lifecycles.
