Clinton Wolfe works with Atlanta-based Relus Technologies, where he helps organizations adopt DevOps culture and practices as they move to the cloud. That also means he voluntarily chooses to go into heavily siloed, dysfunctional organizations and try to get them to talk to each other with as few stabbings as possible. He’s especially interested in testable infrastructure, and the processes needed to support quality throughout the application lifecycle. He is also Oliver and Sylvia’s Daddy.

I’ve spoken at ChefConf 2013-2015, a bunch of DevOpsDays, and Surge 2016. I am the organizer of the Philly DevOps Meetup, and you should come hang out with us.
