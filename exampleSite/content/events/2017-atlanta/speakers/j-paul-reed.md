J. Paul Reed started his career in technology over fifteen years ago in the trenches as a build/release and tools engineer, working with such storied organizations as VMware, Mozilla, Postbox, and Symantec.

In 2012, he founded Release Engineering Approaches, a consultancy incorporating a host of tools and techniques to help organizations "Simply Ship. Every time." His approaches work because they take into account not only the technology issues at hand, but the organizational dynamics that affect the teams who implement and operate that technology.

Since its founding, Paul has had the opportunity to work across a number of industries, from financial services and healthcare to cloud-based infrastructure startups and the federal government. He's helped teams from 2 to 200 on every aspect of the software delivery process, including tooling, continuous delivery pipelines, operational analysis and improvement, team culture transformation, and business value optimization.

Paul is an internationally recognized speaker on DevOps, release engineering, and operations complexity. He's written articles for O'Reilly, DZone, and Atlassian and is the author of DevOps in Practice.

He is also the founding host of The Ship Show, a twice-monthly podcast tackling topics related to build engineering, DevOps, and release management.
