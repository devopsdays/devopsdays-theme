Josh Lohrman is a Platform Integration Architect at The Weather Company, and IBM Business. He doesn’t know what that means either. He has 15 years combined experience with Development, Operations, Devops, and Architecture, which doesn’t hold a candle to the 32 years experience he has interacting with incredible minds around the world that shaped how he thinks and interacts.

When not spending this time hating the work stated above, Josh is a musician whom’s poison of choice is guitar, as well as an avid tabletop gamer.
