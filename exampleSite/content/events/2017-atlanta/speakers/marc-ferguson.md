Marc, at his core, is an open source front-end web developer from a galaxy far, far away. When he’s not fighting imperial regimes he falls into his role as a mild-mannered husband raising three titans-of-industry. A busy and productive life often requires the counter balance of slothful recreations. For fun Marc pwn noobz, farm resources, and plays-the-objective, which results in a higher state of “gamerscore.”
