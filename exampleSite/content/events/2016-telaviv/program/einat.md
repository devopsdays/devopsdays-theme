  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
  Statistics for Engineers
  </p>

  <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

  <p>
  We all know the power of parallel computation, and aspire to use it whenever we can to improve performance.
  Often we need to calculate a statistical attribute of our data, such as: average, variance or percentiles.
  
  In this workshop we will define what is required of a statistical attribute in order to be able to calculate in parallel, and go over several such implementations.
  We will also go over a few measurements from the world of click-stream analysis and evaluate if we can parallelize their calculation.
