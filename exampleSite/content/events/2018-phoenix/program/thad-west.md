While DevOps is a very appealing model on paper, many organizations donâ€™t take into account changes to culture and collaboration required to be successful. The standard model depiction as a moebius strip masks the dangers of team siloing. While discrete organizational units are key in proper staffing and skill allocation, sharp divisions can easily cause DevOps efforts to experience partial or complete failure.

Successful DevOps requires a cultural shift where the boundaries between groups are softened. Though individual groups should still be responsible for specific organizational functions, they should also embrace transparent processes and collaboration with other groups that are part of the DevOps cycle. As the size and complexity of organizations increases, this becomes increasingly important.

We will be looking at some of the common organizational culture changes embraced by successful DevOps adoptions. We will also show how proper tooling helps with this process by increasing collaboration between teams, using the Atlassian toolset as an example of tools intended to facilitate cultural and collaborative changes.
