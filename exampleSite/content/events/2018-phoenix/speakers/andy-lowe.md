As a developer and product manager with nearly two decades experience in multiple industries, Andy has built some really cool products (and some others).  Along the way, he developed a strong interest in finding smarter ways to build quality software and an even stronger aversion to doing things that get in the way of that goal.  As a portfolio lead in Allstate's Automation Engineering group, he is currently responsible for building products that other development teams use daily.  He likes spending his nights and weekends not doing release activities and wants other teams to have the same flexibility.  Andy's favorite dessert is cookies.
