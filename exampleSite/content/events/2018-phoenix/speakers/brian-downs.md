Software Engineer. I have a passion for all things Go, AWS, FreeBSD, and programming in general. I spend free time contributing to open source projects and spend a large portion of time mentoring others. I run the Phoenix Go meetup helping to build a larger Go community and help those get Go programs developed in more companies here in the valley and co-organize BSD-PHX.
