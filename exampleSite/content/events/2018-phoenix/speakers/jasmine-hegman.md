I have been programming and architecting software seriously for many years. There is always more to learn, and I consider that a good thing. Over time I have amassed a bit of knowledge and it has come in handy and I enjoy sharing it with others. I've done everything from web and game front and back ends to the tooling involved in making both to the infrastructure that helps run both. I am extremely thankful for all of the people, opportunities, and experiences that have afforded me the chances to learn those things, and I look forward to being able to share some of what I've learned with others.
