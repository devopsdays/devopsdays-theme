Mark has been a software developer for over 20 years, working in diverse industries and technologies. He holds an undergraduate degree from Emory University but can't remember in what because he spent all his time in the computer lab and gym. It definitely qualifies him to be a barista though. He almost holds a Masters of Business Administration and almost a Masters of Decision Sciences but suffers from extreme attention deficit when it comes to any curriculum that contains classes on Marketing.

Mostly these days he enjoys CrossFit, Coding, and yelling at kids to get off his lawn.
