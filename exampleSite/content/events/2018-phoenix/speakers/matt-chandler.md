Matt is the founder and President of Sierra Ancha Solutions, where he helps organizations improve their software engineering processes and culture. After years of building software in environments from tiny startups to huge enterprises, Matt has learned that building high-quality software doesn’t have to be hard and software teams don’t have to miss deadlines or work perpetual overtime. When not helping teams be happier and more productive, Matt enjoys building and riding custom motorcycles, writing code, and exploring the outdoors.
