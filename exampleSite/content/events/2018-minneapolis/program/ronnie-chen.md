Technical diving involves working with systems that interact in complicated ways in a high pressure environment where failures are unavoidable but also highly dangerous. This talk uses the framework of technical SCUBA and rebreather diving to talk about patterns for failure management and how they can be applied in an engineering context. It examines the ways that complex systems fail and challenges our heroism-based model of success which ignores consistent, uneventful execution. It also looks into different approaches to risk management and why the typical model is not safe. You will walk away with an understanding of how complex systems fail and how to build resiliency to failure in your system and in your team.
