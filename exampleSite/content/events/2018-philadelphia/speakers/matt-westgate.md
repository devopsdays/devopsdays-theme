Matt Westgate is [Lullabot's](https://www.lullabot.com) CEO. Matt graduated from Iowa State University in Computer-Mediated Technologies, a degree program he built from the ground up to focus on the emerging field of web applications and information architecture.

After university Matt teamed up with John VanDyk to develop Mframework: a metadata-driven Content Management System which later became a cornerstone to the foundation of Drupal's CCK platform. Matt also contributed the path aliasing module and table sort library to Drupal core. Then he wrote the original e-commerce package as a proof-of-concept that Drupal was much much more than a CMS. Matt and John went on to author the Pro Drupal Development book, a must-have resource for any Drupal core developer.

Matt is also the CEO of [Tugboat.QA](https://tugboat.qa), a CI/CD that builds automated full-stack preview and test environments for web applications.
