Inspired by the recent DevOps Enterprise Summit (DOES) 2018 presentation of the same name, this lighting talk shares confessions and lessons learned from local DevOps initiatives and observations from DOES. While this talk sheds light onto the dark side of DevOps, it provides insight into the different stages of a technology transformation.
