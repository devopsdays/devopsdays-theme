UX is driving you crazy, a black throwing off timelines and killing ideas. UX doesn’t seem Lean or Agile. Can’t anybody make wireframes? Can’t we circumvent or exclude these people?

DevOps is truly about so much more than how developers connect with IT, how infrastructure is managed, and how frameworks can be improved. It’s about recognizing how many teams are truly involved in the software development process and finding better ways to make sure everybody is at the table.

This session will explain how the UX process fits into Agile; saves companies money; augments DevOps goals; and increases customer satisfaction.

1. Learn that DevOps goals overlap with UX goals.
2. Correct integration of UX experts and tasks saves time and money, increases productivity and efficiency, creates the best idea execution for the target customers, and keeps engineering’s changes and rebuilds to a minimum.
3. Learn how UX specialists conduct user research; design your entire product, app, website, or system; validate it through user testing; iterate to fix flaws; and deliver vetted blueprints so you can build once.
4. How User-Centered Design fits into project timelines and development methodologies including Agile and Lean.
