Scott works for Cisco Systems, Inc. as a Systems Engineer in the CX Platform Engineering group focusing on Kubernetes, Docker, and open source software.  Prior to this position, he spent 20 years in a small support group in academia, and now works at a fortune 500 company, in the information technology industry deploying multiple services and systems. At North Carolina State University, he helped maintain one of the first High-Performance Computing Clusters on campus and was an early adopter of Containers to support research and administrative functions.  Three years ago, he moved into his current position based on his experience working with new technologies to help maintain and stabilize a microservice based application deployed in a Kubernetes cluster. Since then, the CX Platform Engineering group has accelerated their adoption of DevOps practices. All current and future applications are being built in this environment. The team was already using some DevOps concepts, but they have now accelerated their adoption of DevOps and Kubernetes practices in their systems.

In his spare time, Scott enjoys researching historical foodways, tinkering with electronics, playing in his woodshop, and volunteering as a costumed interpreter at Jamestown Settlement.
