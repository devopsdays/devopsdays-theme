Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CI\CD) concepts are increasingly adopted by many technology organizations and teams. CI\CD enables teams to establish processes that increase velocity, collaboration and quality of their codebase. CI\CD enables developer & operations teams to breakdown unnecessary silos and gain a deeper knowledge of their respective arenas.

In this workshop the participants will be introduced to the basic fundamentals of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment. Participants will learn the core principles of CI\CD and have the opportunity to reinforce what theyâ€™ve learned in a hands on workshop featuring the CircleCI platform.  The workshop will demonstrate ci\cd build configuration, code commits, commit builds, code testing and packaging.  The participants will leave with a hands-on experience and understanding of what it takes to CI\CD.
