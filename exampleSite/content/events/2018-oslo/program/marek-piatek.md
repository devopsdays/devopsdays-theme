Do you like coding on your laptop, pushing the code to git and getting it automatically built and deployed? What if you were told you can’t, got a Windows 7 x32 machine and was hired to transform the bank into a tech platform?

In this talk we’ll describe main technical challenges we have faced during DNB’s journey to the cloud. You will hear about synchronising user management systems across a service mesh, VPNing to your bank when in bank, replacing absurdly obsolete solutions with industry standards and revisiting industry standards to see if they are smart enough.
