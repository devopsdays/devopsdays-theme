If you were last year at DevOpsDays most probably, you noticed Ignite talk about security challenges in DevOps. So how things changed in the security lately? What new lessons we can learn? Or are we still failing in same traps?
This talk is aka the stand-up comedy about security failures and success. Thru the humor let’s look into the experience of daily security work. Learn from others mistakes in building applications, securing environments, dealing with business to prioritize security debts, etc.
