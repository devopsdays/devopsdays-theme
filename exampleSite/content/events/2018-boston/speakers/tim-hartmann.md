Tim is a unique and beautiful snowflake who enjoys biking to work, playing Legos with his kid. Tim has been interested in Systems Administration since he discovered ANSI art on a BBS while in High School. As an infrastructure engineer heâ€™s worked at Harvard on the Unix, Networking, and Research Computing teams. His current role as an SRE at ASICS / Runkeeper perpetually learning, laughing, and helping to transform a traditional retailer into a software driven business, one pull request at a time. It his his profound pleasure to be learning new things all the time, and boldly falling down the ethernet.
