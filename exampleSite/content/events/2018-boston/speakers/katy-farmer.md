Katy lives in Oakland, CA with her husband and two dogs (at least one of whom talks to her about fun, technical stuff), but has lived in lots of places from East Coast to West Coast. She loves to experiment with code, break stuff, and try to fix it. Over the years, she’s been an editor, juice bar barista, IT technician, and manual laborer, so she’s learned to fail and try again in a lot of industries. Ask her about Ruby, OOP, Go, video game development, Russian Literature, Star Wars, Dragon Age, or chord progressions–she’ll be your friend right away.
