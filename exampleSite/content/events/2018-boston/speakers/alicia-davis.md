I’m like a mullet - in the front I’m versed in DevOps, Enterprise Architecture, and Systems Engineering (have the degrees & scars to prove it), and combination of jokes, dogs, rap music, and wine in the back. I work in consulting in my day job, after accumulating over 10 years in Engineering and IT, and enjoy helping coworkers and customers implement all flavors of DevOps. I also co-organize the Nashville Kubernetes meetup.
….and clearly One Direction sucks.
