I am a software architect, developer, an Agile proponent, and a believer in building valuable software that users will love to use. I build large back-end systems that require high-performance and high-reliability, and process vast amounts of data. Our most successful projects rise from excellent communication, rapid iterations, close contact with the client, and quality infrastructure.
