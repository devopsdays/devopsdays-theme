Data-Shuffler is an tool we've developed at Ithaka to manage data processing across the organization.   Data-Shuffler is allowing us to decentralize ownership of data-processing, ETL, and BI.  Our organization is able to deliver tested, robust datasets much more rapidly than before, and we're able to place the developers and analysts who understand their data best in a position to quickly access and transform data at production scale.
