Over the past 7 years of the DevOps movement, there has been a healthy tension between behavior, speed, and resilience. Empirical and analytical evidence suggests that when these three are in equilibria the outcomes create organizational performance. With behavior being an anchor of organizational performance. In DevSecOps, the motivation is to embed security patterns and practices into existing DevOps capabilities thereby creating similar equilibria with increased organizational performance. In this session we are going to observe the IT security practices over the past 10 years that one might suggest having had a metaphorically “felonious” narrative based on the resultant outcomes. In the DevSecOps metaphorically “divine” narrative we will see once again that it’s not all just about technology, however, performance outcomes will again be heavily anchored in our behaviors.
