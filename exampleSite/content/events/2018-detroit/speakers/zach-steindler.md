Zach has helped out with many meetups and events in Ann Arbor over the years. He's co-founded meetups (CoffeeHouseCoders) and companies (Olark). When he isn't working he enjoys camping and biking, sometimes at the same time. His favorite hobbies often involve making computers do unusual things, like woodworking or drawing aperiodic tilings. If you have five minutes, ask him why hexagons are way cooler than squares.
