Desy Kristianti is a Technology Consultant at Deloitte and a City Leader at Women Who Code (WWCode) Belfast. Two years ago, she disliked being the centre of attention and having to speak in public. However, her passion for sharing her knowledge overpowered these fears and she started going to public speaking practice and workshops.

Desy has now spoken at three conferences in Belfast and London, giving technical talks in rooms full of 100+ audiences. Her technique focuses on audience engagements and really understanding what they are looking for. In her day job, Desy has also given technical presentations to key senior clients and managers with little technical backgrounds.
