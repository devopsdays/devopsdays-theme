In an ideal software development world a centralised CI/CD model has a huge number of benefits but as your organisation scales so does the complexity of your pipeline. You may end up with multiple teams working on the same technology stack that have different tooling and deployment needs.

This talk will go through a practical example of a paradigm shift from a centralized to a decentralised CI/CD model focusing primarily on infrastructure and configuration management. I will present how we decoupled and simplified our deployment process to empower developers to own their own pipelines. This talk will also cover the technical and organisational scaling challenges we faced, how we embraced risk and the lessons we learned.
