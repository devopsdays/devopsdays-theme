You’re working on the infrastructure supporting several multi-million pound replatforming projects and you’ve only got nine months to deliver. The trouble is, you don’t know what it is you should be building and all your stakeholders are shouting at the top of their lungs that their need is the number one priority. What do you? In this talk, I’ll discuss my experience working on exactly this problem, the techniques we took from the software delivery world and how they can be applied to an infrastructure build, as well as examining those that led to success and the things that didn’t work out so well.
