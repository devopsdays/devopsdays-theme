AviD is a high-end, independent security architect and developer, and has been designing, developing and testing secure applications, and leading development teams in building secure products, for around 20 years. My research interests include efficient security engineering, relationship between usability and security, and scalable enterprise security systems.

For the past $X years, Iâ€™ve been working as a software security consultant, supporting organizations of all sizes in integrating security methodologies and products into their development processes. Now leading Bounce Security, a small boutique consultancy, I spend a lot of time with development teams, often providing training on secure coding and other security topics. I am also a frequent speaker at industry conferences, such as OWASP, RSA, BSides, and DevSecCon.

I also lead the OWASP Israel chapter, am a community moderator on https://security.StackExchange.com/, and a volunteer high school tech teacher.
