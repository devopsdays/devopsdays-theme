Stephen Nelson-Smith is technical delivery coach at Ticketmaster International, where he works to bring continuous improvement in all areas of the technical organisation, covering architecture, people, and process.  A deeply experienced infrastructure developer, he is considered one of the earliest pioneers of the Devops  movement, and his O'Reilly books on Test-Driven Infrastructure with Chef brought about a paradigm shift in configuration management.  Beyond his work interests, he competes internationally in both Table Tennis and Chess, and is a keen student of Russian literature.
