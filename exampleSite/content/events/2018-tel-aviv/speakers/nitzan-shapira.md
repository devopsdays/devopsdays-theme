I am a software engineer with over 12 years of experience in programming, machine learning, cyber-security, and reverse engineering. During the last year, I am working on Epsagon, being a co-founder and the CEO. Epsagon is focused on bringing observability to serverless cloud applications, using distributed tracing and AI technologies, tackling the unique challenges in such environments.

Apart from co-founding Epsagon, I enjoy playing the piano, I am a traveling enthusiast, an experienced chess player, and addicted to sports.
