My name is Omer, I am an engineer at ProdOps. I work with companies to improve their delivery processes and ops architecture to be as automated, painless and robust as possible. I try to automate everything, but avoid hacky ways in the process.

And in a less official note… People shouldn’t listen to me, but they can :) Use CrystalLang to make the world a better place!
