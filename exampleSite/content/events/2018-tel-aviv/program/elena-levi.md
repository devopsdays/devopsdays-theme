Charts are a very useful and easy way to present information. 

The problem is that when done wrong, they can do more damage than good. They can be completely useless or even worse - lie and deceive.

Picking the right type of chart for your data is just half way to success. On top of that you'd have to know your way around the data.

So, do you have what it takes to create the perfect chart?
