I lead the newly formed Cloud Ops Advocacy team in Azure engineering. Prior to Microsoft, I worked at Amazon Web Services (AWS) where I led the EMEA Marketing & Evangelism and WW Partner Marketing organizations. I have a passion for supporting the IT Operations community having spent the first half of my career as a sysadmin building and operating heterogeneous Unix, Linux, and Windows environments.
