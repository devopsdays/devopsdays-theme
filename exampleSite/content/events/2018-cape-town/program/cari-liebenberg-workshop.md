##### WORKSHOP ABSTRACT

Wouldn't it be great to add and remove containers from a cluster without having to write or update complex yml scripts? Rancher can help your team manage running containers with less strain. Once you have Rancher up and running and your nodes set up, you can easily add containers, scale your running containers and redeploy containers, all from an interactive dashboard interface.

Rancher can help your team feel more empowered and in control of changing cloud environments.
