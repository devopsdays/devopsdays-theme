Google App Engine is a very powerful but also a mostly unknown service featuring a serverless design. It allowed me to run my php-based website: www.url.rw, that generated more than 12 million page views in July 2018 with zero downtime and scaled perfectly / seamlessly up & down according to my traffic needs. Total costs for that month: 10USD. In this talk I will give a quick introduction on what Google App Engine is, what problems it can (+not) solve and my fight with scaling EC2 hence my love for serverless architecture/design!
