Human animal, male, slightly overweight. First non-fiction book I ever read was Teach yourself C programming in 24 days. This was before I had access to any computer smarter than my casio wristwatch. Some rich people taught me how money works and now Iâ€™m helping communities thrive at Zoona, a payment systems provider in Zambia and Malawi. We aspire to create a digital finance platform that will touch the lives of a Billion people in the next few years. Our release manager calls me his DevOps.
