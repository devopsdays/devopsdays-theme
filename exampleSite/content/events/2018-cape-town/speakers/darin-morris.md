Darin has worked full time in the software development space since 2006 and his experience is fairly broad and unique. Over the years he has been a founder, manager, team lead and (full stack) software engineer, in various sectors, and in teams of different shapes and sizes.
He first seriously forayed into the tech industry when he started his first software development business with the support of ICT incubator MambaVen â€“ back when he was just 17.

His interests are varied, though he is currently particularity interested in cloud computing, software security and the processes that drive high quality software development, and much of the work he has done over the years has revolved around these areas.
Darin is a also member of the OWASP, the ISACA and the IITPSA.
