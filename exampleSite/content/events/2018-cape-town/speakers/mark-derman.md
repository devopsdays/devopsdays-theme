Mark is a long time full-stack .NET developer enthusiast, having first taken SafariNow.com to Production on .Net V1.0 beta back in the early 2000's. He has a passion for quality, testability and reliability, and getting solutions and code elegant and correct. Based at Direct Axis, he is helping the dev teams with DevOps and other modernisation initiatives where he can. Madly keen windsurfer, and a born and bred 80s music fan. Talk to me about archetypal psychology anytime.
