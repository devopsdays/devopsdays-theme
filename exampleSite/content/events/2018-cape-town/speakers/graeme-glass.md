Graeme is a software developer who, over the last 15 years, has worked for startups, corporates and as a freelancer/consultant. Over the years, he has learnt a trick or 2 about writing and deploying software and can maybe say something to help you along your journey. A huge fan of Python, Open Source and automating as many things as possible. He dreams of a world where one day printers will just work regardless of OS, location or brand; then maybe I can stop doing family tech support...
