  <h2>Are we bridging the cultural divide that is necessary for DevOps to succeed</h2>
  <p>
  Discussion about the pitfalls and problems we are facing when trying to implement DevOps either bottom up or top down. Putting tools aside, in my travels across APAC I see breakdowns occurring with organizations that are not executing well when it comes to DevOps. For instance in India and China and Korea and Japan it is very slow, in Singapore and Australia and NZ it is picking up, but still with lots of room for improvement. How can we all together get better adoption of DevOps and ultimately get better code into production to support business outcomes.
