  <h2>Can't keep it simple, stupid!</h2>
  <p>
  Shows how you can explain the difference between simple, complicated and complex environments - and how certain ways of managing them fit their nature - to your team/management who still think DevOps is a hipe and will go away if you just wait long enough. In short: yes, you can try to manage a complex environment with your simple environment strategies and tools. But you will fail. Change your strategy and call it what you like - but change!
