Living deep in Amazon country (Seattle), Daniel has avoided the tech giant's
clutches, instead pursuing a love for travel by working for the world's biggest
internet travel company, Booking.com! Previously based in Cambridge, UK, Daniel spent many years in the university city first working on mobile billing, then
connecting people to knowledge before returning to the University of Cambridge
to develop educational technology. After years in Academia, Daniel became a
Booking.com sysadmin in 2014. Having worked on systems to send thousands of faxes and platforms to process billions of logs, Daniel now oversees various
core infrastructure services. In his spare time, Daniel chases after 4 kids who
love exploring the world even more than him!
