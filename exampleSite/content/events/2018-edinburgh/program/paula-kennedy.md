Ever find yourself thinking about things you know now that you wish you’d known at the start of your career? Or maybe you’re at the start of your career and you’re looking for some tips and advice to help you on your journey? In this talk, Paula will reflect on her career of 18 years in the technology industry and will share past experiences as well as lessons learned. Though technology itself has changed and continues to evolve at a fast pace as described by Moore’s Law, there are many areas such as balancing work and home life, working in a team, dealing with conflict etc that remain consistently challenging. As Baz Luhrman’s song says, “my advice has no basis more reliable than my own meandering experience...I will dispense this advice now”.
