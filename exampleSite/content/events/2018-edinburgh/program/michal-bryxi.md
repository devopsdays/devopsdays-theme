When we started our project we had just a high level vision. As we dissected the idea into smaller pieces questions started to appear. Which framework to use? Database? Hosting? There are a lot of questions and the whole Internet with the best™ technologies to solve our problems. Any silver bullet?

The author tries to elaborate on why he thinks that incremental, small improvements shipped early & often are a better option - even if they might have flaws. He shows the JIT technique to solve problems. He shows why it’s completely OK to be overwhelmed by technologies and how to let go.
