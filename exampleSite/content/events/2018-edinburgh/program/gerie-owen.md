Continuous testing is one of the most effective ways of building quality into the software delivery pipeline. Although effective test automation throughout the delivery pipeline is a must, continuous testing requires the entire team to be responsible for quality as well as new approaches to testing.

In this presentation, you’ll learn how to implement an effective continuous test strategy. We’ll look at examples of what works and what doesn’t. You’ll learn how to optimize test scope and test cases to create effective test automation. We’ll explore advanced analytics, service virtualization and data management and learn how to use them to enhance your continuous testing strategy. Finally, you’ll learn the importance of implementing production monitoring including automated test triggers, service health monitoring, and root cause identification. Attendees take home a clear understanding of how to implement a successful continuous testing approach.
