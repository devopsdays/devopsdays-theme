Dad, husband, aspiring world traveler and avid reader, Todd Brees spent many years out with the unwashed masses managing retail before he saw the light and decided to start speaking at tech conferences.  He dropped everything, went back to school and obtained a Masters of Computer Science, now spending his days in front of a computer moving 0s and 1s just so he can come and stand in front of you and talk.
