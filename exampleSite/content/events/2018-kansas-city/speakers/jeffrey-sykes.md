Director of TechOps
Jeffrey joined VML in 2009 and is the director of technical operations. In his current role, he leads a team of systems architects, engineers and administrators on VML's TechOps team while continuing to support clients. Because of lessons learned supporting high-volume sites and applications on a variety of platforms, Jeffrey and his team are zealous followers of DevOps methodologies. From continuous integration to continuous delivery to infrastructure as code, the team is always looking for ways to improve processes and streamline work. Jeffrey has developed server and cloud architectures for many different technical stacks. Additionally, he has participated in the creation of the architectural review process at VML to help broadly share the lessons learned and best practices for projects.
