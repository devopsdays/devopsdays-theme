Coder. Puzzler. Solver. Embracing the DevOps revolution. Voice tech enthusiast and avid consumer of AR -VR. Interested in AI, Machine Learning and "the cloud".

I've been coding since I was 5 and my dad taught me my first print goto loop. I've been coding professionally for the last 14 years. I've been working with Alexa since her SDK was released in 2015-2016.

(Hopefully by the time i give this presentation, my skill will be live.)
