Get that Alexa skill out of your head and into the marketplace.

We'll talk about:

* How to develop your utterances and decide to use strict variable matching.
* How to test for potential synonym drift when using a not using strict matching.
* How to deploy multi-file lambdas, and discuss Java cold starts and warmers and * if that should effect your programing language of choice.
* What the jury is looking for and best practices for skill coding.
* How to troubleshoot and test using the phone app or the Echosim.io.

By the time you are done with this workshop, you have the necessary know-how to get your app past the jury and into the marketplace!
Notes and comments

The plan is to make this an active workshop. You'll need your laptop, (or some coding device,) your aws account and a Alexa developer account. Everything else we'll have in class.

An alexa on your phone may help, but is not necessary.

Let's have fun!
