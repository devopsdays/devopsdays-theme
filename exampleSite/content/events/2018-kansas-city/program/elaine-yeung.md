In August 2017, Blizzard Entertainment and Deep Mind released a StarCraft 2 Learning Environment (SC2LE) designed to take machine learning to the next level. The initial set up of the SC2LE development environment (without Docker) took over a day to troubleshoot and install. In this session, Elaine will share how within a month she taught herself how to use Docker and how containers allowed her to cut the time needed to set up SC2LE from over 18 hours to under 30 minutes.
