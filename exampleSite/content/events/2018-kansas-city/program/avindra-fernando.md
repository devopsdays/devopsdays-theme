We live in a world where our colleagues may not necessarily be seated next to us, or be in the same city, or even in the same country for that matter. More and more tech companies today, have a global workforce. Having an internationally diverse workforce with varied experiences and perspectives, allow companies to compete in the rapidly evolving technological environment.

But, geographically dispersed teams also come with a set of challenges that companies have to overcome. Managing and maintaining high performing development teams is a hard enough task even when the teams are co-located. When the team members come from different backgrounds and locations, it makes it even harder. Communication can deteriorate, misunderstandings can occur, teams may stop trusting each other, which can ultimately affect the success of the company.

Over the years, I have worked with several global development teams. We have experienced many challenges during our interactions and have since figured out ways on how to effectively overcome most of them.

In this session, I would like to share, various approaches, tips and tricks that I have used in my career to build a strong relationship among the team members across the globe. This session will enable you to be a part of a high performing development team irrespective of the geographical and cultural differences.
