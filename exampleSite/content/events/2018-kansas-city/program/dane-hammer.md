Last year I joined a company halfway through migrating from monolith to microservices. On the team responsible for the deployment of everything, as well as some services themselves, I have a unique view into how it's going.

This talk will share my observations of what it's like for an outsider to come to a microservice architecture, with some things that are going well and some things to avoid, so you can inform your own plans if you choose to go this route.
