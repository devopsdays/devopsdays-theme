The tech industry aligns with DevOps being a set of practices and culture that an organization uses to deliver operational excellence. DevOps should not be a team, tools, or something you hire a consultant for. In development or operations practices anti-patterns are behaviors that crop up which hinder the best efforts of an organization. Learn to how to identify these DevOps Culture Anti-patterns (like tribal knowledge, silos, etc.), and then attack them in specific ways to resolve these issues.

* Tribal Knowledge
* Super Hero Culture
* Silos
* Centralized Decision Making
* Quality at the end of the development process
* Information Hoarding
* Manual processes

How you respond to and learn to change from failures will determine the outcome of your journey. A DevOps journey is just that, a road in which the final state is always reset once you cross the finish line and head towards the new goal.
