While the use of configuration management tools, like Chef or Ansible, have taken off, it seems as though many engineers still manually test their Infrastructure code.

Adding automation to your testing process greatly improves the reliability of your infrastructure code, reduces the chances that mistakes are made, and even improves time to deploy.

We will be creating and testing a simple Puppet module using the Puppet Development Kit/RSpec/Docker and adding that to a Gitlab Pipeline. No prior knowledge of Puppet is required.

If time permits (and there are no questions), I may demonstrate the process again with Chef.
