##### KEYNOTE ABSTRACT

For years we laboured under the misapprehension that going faster meant breaking things. After several years of science-ing, Jez and Dr Nicole Forsgren have identified the key elements that enable not just higher throughput but also higher stability, availability and quality, lower cost, and happier teams. Discover how continuous delivery, cloud infrastructure, and effective management and leadership practices produce higher software delivery performance (and indeed what we might mean by performance), along with how to measure culture and its impact on IT and organizational culture. Find out how we actually ensure our results are reliable and meaningful. Learn the patterns and practices used by high performing organizations to outcompete their peers.
