##### TALK ABSTRACT

Karith brings her wit, wisdom and humor to two of the hottest people topics in DevOps: Interpersonal Communication and Imposter Syndrome.

Primary to breaking down silos in organizations is breaking down barriers between people who look at the world in very different ways.  Karith breaks us out of the traditional view of diversity and inclusion by offering a truly inclusive perspective on communication, learning, and creating an environment vital to organizational success. 

DevOps is also about learning to build a habit of continual personal improvement.  Negative internal dialogues, like imposter syndrome, can act as obstacles for living our best life personally, professionally and academically. Karith cuts right to the heart of the matter on the messages we tell ourselves in this high-energy, interactive presentation.  Karith will tell us why “<strong><i>You are enough</i></strong>” and how to cultivate growth and personal improvement.
