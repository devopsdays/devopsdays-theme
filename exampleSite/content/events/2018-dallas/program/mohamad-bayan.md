##### IGNITE TALK ABSTRACT

In the past few years, large enterprises started adopting the microservices architecture, however, most ended up with a “distributed monolith” and could not realize the true benefits of microservices. In this talk, I will discuss the challenges of how we built microservices in the past and and what the future strategy should look like. The strategy of leveraging the “platform” (container orchestration + Service Mesh) to provide the outer-architecture capabilities in order to build business-focused polyglot services that are decoupled from the outer architecture.
