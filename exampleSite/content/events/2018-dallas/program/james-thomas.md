##### IGNITE TALK ABSTRACT

Over the past year or so I’ve been focusing a good amount on trying to help clients move toward a Continuous Delivery/Continuous Deployment mindset. To that end, I’ve spent a lot of time building pipelines in various CI tools. Something that’s become a common tool in my kit is using Docker containers to build the various projects in our pipelines. This has a lot of very interesting benefits, but also comes with a few challenges.

In my talk I’ll tell you why you should care about building your software with Docker. I will also outline the plusses and minuses of this approach, and relay as many of the various tips and tricks I’ve found in my use of it over the past year or so. After my talk is over you should have a clear understanding of this approach, and whether or not you should trial it.
