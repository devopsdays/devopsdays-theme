##### TALK ABSTRACT

Even though I am an Olympian and Stanford Graduate, I had become the Chief Minimizing Officer of my life. My recent breakthrough during Harada Training has changed my life and I want to share with you.

As an Olympian, I have experienced many amazing adventures and opportunities in my life. Since retiring from my sport, I have been working in IT for over 20 years and been a Scrum Master for the past 7 years. Recently I have made some important connections between my athletic experience and my current role as Scrum Master role with Toyota Connected. In addition, I was inspired by Jim Lippens and the Harada Training we received this year. My new goal is to become a Certified Harada Training and inspire others to recognize their worth and their true potential and to create great teams.

My unique experience has compelled me to share recommendations for how to make great teams and develop people. Since attending our Harada Training at Toyota Connected, my entire mindset has changed. My goal is to share what I know and inspire others.
