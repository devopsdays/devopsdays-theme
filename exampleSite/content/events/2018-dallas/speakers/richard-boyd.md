I’ve been working with AWS for over six years and have been a SysAd / Systems Engineer / Computer Nerd for close to two decades. I’m a Senior Technical Account Manager with Amazon Web Services, helping customers build amazing things with our cloud platform and tools. In my spare time I’m an organizer for DevOpsDays Austin and a volunteer with Girl Scouts. I also love to check out the craft brew scene in Texas and am working on blogging as a bit of personal kaizen. In a previous life I was an Eagle Scout and am an Iraq Veteran.
