The devopsdays DFW community is always seeking to help the underrepresented diverse and/or marginalized group in the technology and/or open source communities. We value everyone's opinion, thought, and experience. We recognize that one barrier to attending conferences is that people may not have the privilege of working at a company that can afford them to attend, are self-employed or students with a limited budget to pay for admissions.

Share why you are an awesome example of diversity within the devopsdays DFW community for a chance to receive a complimentary pass to devopsdays DFW 2017 conference. Make sure you submit your application before the July 30th deadline, to get your chance to join all of us at Capital One Conference Center in Plano, TX.  Fill out the following form:

DevOpsDays DFW is a self-organizing conference for DevOps practitioners that is made possible by local volunteers and corporate sponsorships, we never sell product presentations, nor do we distribute attendee contact lists. This is a community event that provides an opportunity for local current practitioners and those interested in learning, to benefit from the DevOps community.
We anticipate attendance will quickly reach the venue’s full capacity of 480 enthusiastic IT professionals with over 2,400 technology companies in Dallas metro area.  Most attendees that support this conference are part of a growing community of DevOps professionals, Agile leaders, Scrum masters, Open Source developers, and Cloud experts.
