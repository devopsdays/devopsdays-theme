Docker has solved all of our problems, the ones left behind were solved by Kubernetes. Everybody and their neighbour is Scrum certified now and we are all happily sipping cocktails on the beach. Or not? Why after almost 10 years of pushing culture change, teaching about Infrastructure as Code, teaching about Monitoring and Metrics and help people to share both their pain and their learnings are most organisations still struggling with software delivery.

I’ve spent the better part of the last two decades helping both large and small organisations to deliver their software faster with Open Source tools. Somewhere half way that journey we started a conference that lead to the #devops movement. Some of those organisations succeeded in their goals, some didn’t, yet they are talking about their huge successes at conferences preaching the #devops word.

With the knowledge that to a lot of people the word #devops has lost it’s meaning is there a future for #devops? This talk will bring you some ideas about that future … and why we still have to keep teaching people what DevOps is really about.
