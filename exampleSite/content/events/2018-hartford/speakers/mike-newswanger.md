I enjoy solving problems, particularly those related to scale. I've worked in all parts of the application development lifecycle–from inception to deployment–and enjoy the challenges of creating secure, performant, resilient, and maintainable code and infrastructure. I'm currently a Software Engineer at Elastic; previously Site Reliability Engineer at Stack Overflow.
