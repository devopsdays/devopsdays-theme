After an early career in UNIX and Linux system administration, Iâ€™m now working on hybrid cloud computing, containerization, Lean IT, and DevOps at USPTO. My current interests include infrastructure as code, systems thinking SPEAKERBIO learning organizations, and the application of concepts from safety science, cognitive engineering and complexity theory to DevOps.
