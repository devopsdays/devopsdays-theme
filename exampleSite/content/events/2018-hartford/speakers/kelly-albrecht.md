As an Agile and Jira Coach for Last Call Media, I facilitate cultures of continuous improvement internally and for clients, delivering better products by getting production teams and customers closer together through automation and empathy.

I have been a regular presenter at Meetups, mostly in New York and New England. I've spoken at many IT Camps, including several times at NYCCamp in NYC and Design4Drupal in Boston, giving a Keynote there on Agile Design in 2017. Before that I was the 2016 DrupalCamp Ottawa Keynote.

I am the lead organizer of NERD Summit, giving many talks, and have been its MC the past three years.

I've also had the honor to speak at DrupalCons in Prague, as well as NOLA, Baltimore, and Nashville.
