In modern corporate world, your boss would have assigned you at-least 33% (1 out of 3) Key Performance Index (KPI) for each year for 'Innovation'. And you might have joined in the innovation councils/teams/Hackathon/Lab to contribute, only to realize that we brainstorm forever and even if ideas do get generated, there is no Business hunger for it.
