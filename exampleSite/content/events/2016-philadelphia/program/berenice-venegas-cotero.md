  <p><strong>Title:</strong>
Automation of Data Analysis in AWS
</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p>
Cloud computing and the advancement of tools for resource management and infrastructure automation
have created unconventional forms of processing massive amounts of data, both efficiently, reliably
and cost effectively.
The effects of cloud computing can be visible in everyday life.
Academic research is one of the fields that can benefit greatly from cloud computing.
Particularly, genomics projects have successfully adopted cloud computing in research, and some start-ups
have been created to offer services for mapping gene information to find links to pathologies by using AWS.
Beyond genomics research projects, there is a vast amount of geospatial, satellite imagery, weather, news and
other types of data available for analysis (https://aws.amazon.com/public-data-sets). To date, most
compute intensive research tasks are run in supercomputers; the implementation of cloud computing has not been
as fast as in other areas.
Here it is proposed the utilization of AWS to analyze a set of data, automating the deployment of
infrastructure and trigger analysis when a set of data is uploaded.
This example shows scalability and elasticity of public clouds and
can be easily applied to other types of analytics.
